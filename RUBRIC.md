### **Project Configuration (1-5)** ‚Üí üèóÔ∏è **20%**

Evaluate if the Node.js project is properly set up, dependencies are correctly installed, and scripts are well-defined.

| **Score** | **Criteria**                                                                                         |

| **2**     | Basic project configuration exists but has issues (e.g., missing or incorrect dependencies/scripts). |
| **3**     | Project is mostly configured correctly, with minor issues in dependencies or scripts.                |
