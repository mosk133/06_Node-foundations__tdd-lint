# Node foundations Challenge - TDD and code formatters

Welcome to the **JavaScript Functions Challenge**! Your task is to implement, test, and document JavaScript functions as described below. This updated version includes essential project configuration steps and enhanced testing practices.

## Instructions

### Project Configuration

#### 1. Git & Node Setup

1. Initialize Git

2. Initialize Node Project

#### 2. Test Runner Configuration

1. Install Test Runner (`vitest`)

2. Define Test Script

#### 3. Code Formatters Configuration

1. Install Formatters (`prettier` & `eslint`)

2. Configure ESLint

3. Define format Scripts

### Code Completion

For each exercise:

1. Requirements Compliance:

   - Ensure the function implementation meets the requirements described in the task.

2. Documentation:
   - Use JSDoc notation to document each function (including `throw`).

### Code Testing

1. Test-Driven Development (TDD):

   - Write tests before implementing the function to ensure coverage.

2. Assertions:

   - Each function must include at least five test cases:
     - Validation Errors: Ensure invalid inputs throw appropriate errors.
     - Normal Cases: Verify functionality with standard inputs.

3. Run Tests:
   - Execute test script to validate your code. All tests must pass in üü¢ before submission.

## Workflow

### Branching Strategy

1. Work in `develop` branch:

   - Write and test code for each exercise.
   - Commit changes with descriptive messages, using convention commit notation (e.g., "feat: implement factorial function").

2. Create Pull Request (PR):

   - Submit a PR from `develop` to `main`.

3. Teacher Approval:

   - Await feedback or approval before merging.

## Submission Checklist

1. Functions implemented and documented using JSDoc.
2. All tests written and passing.
3. Changes pushed to the `develop` branch.
4. Pull request created and submitted for review.
